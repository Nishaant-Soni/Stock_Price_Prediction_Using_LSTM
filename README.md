# Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM

## Overview

This project leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict stock prices. Utilizing historical data and technical indicators, the model aims to forecast future stock prices with high accuracy.

## Features

- **Data Retrieval:** Fetches historical stock data using Yahoo Finance.
- **Technical Indicators:** Calculates SMA, RSI, MACD, and other indicators for enhanced feature engineering.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Scales data using MinMaxScaler and creates input sequences for the LSTM model.
- **Model Training:** Implements an LSTM model with hyperparameter tuning using grid search.
- **Evaluation:** Assesses model performance using MSE, MAE, and RÂ² score.
- **Visualization:** Plots actual vs. predicted stock prices and training history.
